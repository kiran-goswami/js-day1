    <h1>java script</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>The first name of java Mocha </li>
        <li>java script is used to make websites interactice</li>
        <li>java script is a client side scripting language</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>function</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>function is a set of statements that perform a task 
      or calculate a values. </li> 
      <li>function avoids the repeatition of writting of code again and again.</li>
      <li>They work only when they are called.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>variables are the containers who stores some values 
          like integers,string e.t.c.
      </p>
      <h2>stages of code execution</h2>
      <b>There are two stages of code execution.</b> 
      <ol>
          <li>compilation</li>
          <li>execution</li>
          <p>
           compilation:-The stage in which the complete source code will be
           converted into machine language code.
          </p>
          <p>execution:-in this stage the code will be executed means all the functions which 
             are written will be executed.
          </p>
      </ol>
      <h2>JS CODE EXECUTION</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>global execution</li>
          <li>execution context</li>
          <li>call stack</li>
          <li>memory allocation</li>
          <li>code execution</li>
      </ul>
      <p>JS CODE EXECUTION:-<br> 
         creation phase:-<br>
          In the first stage "memory allocation" is being provided 
          all the variables will get memory but will not be initialized means their
          value not be given and the value will be like undefined 
          but function will get their values or defination at the time of memory allocation
          only.</p>
          <p>execution phase:-<br>
          In the second stage "code execution" variables will get assigned with their vvalues 
          will get assigned with their true values and functions will be executed.
          </p>
          <h2>call stack</h2>
          <b>In this two phases are there:-</b>
          <ol>
              <li>global execution context<br>
               <b> there are two phases</b> 
                1.creation<br>
                In this first variables got declared.<br>
                Memory will get allocated.<br>
                It will get undefined value<br>
                fuction declaration.<br>
                function defination.<br>
                2.execution<br>
                In this it will get memory<br>
                exact value get defined.<br>
                function will remain same if it is not called<br>
                if called it will move to next phase i.e functional execution context.
                but this phase is not over yet.
              </li>
              <li> functional execution context </li>
             <b>again two phases will created.<br>
              creation  and execution<br>
              same process get repeated and once the execution phase done it will come out.<br>
              after that global execution context completed and it will come out too.</b>
          </ol>
